# A minimal approach to Kepler Objects of Interest classification with 1D CNN

This project proposes a minimal approach to classification of Kepler light curves with machine learning.
The project is centered around a minimal approach, this means that the model used has no novel findings and only
uses standard elements.
The objective of the project is getting the best performance from the simplest model possible, through tuning and
addition or removal of layer from the 1D CNN used.
