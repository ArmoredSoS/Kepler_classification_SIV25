# A minimal approach to Kepler Objects of Interest classification with 1D CNN

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect anomalies in proprietary satellite telemetry time series data. 
The approach combines 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with preprocessing and model evaluation techniques tailored for multivariate, irregular, and unlabeled sensor data.
