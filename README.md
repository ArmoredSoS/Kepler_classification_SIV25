# A minimal approach to Kepler Objects of Interest classification with 1D CNN

## Objective and approach:
  - This project presents a minimalistic approach to the classification of Kepler light curves using machine learning
  - The methodology intentionally avoids novel architectures, relying instead on standard components
  - The primary objective is to achieve strong classification performance using the simplest possible 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), refined through systematic tuning and selective modification of layers.
